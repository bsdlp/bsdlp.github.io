## Hobby

Wrote a [discord bot](https://github.com/tonkat-su/bot) with a bunch of cool features for my private minecraft server my friends play on.

* leaderboard of "time spent online" tracked by metrics in AWS Cloudwatch
* automates adding people to the server allowlist via discord slash commands (i wrote the [go client library feature for this!](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/pull/855))
* "who's online" with everyone's minecraft face using discord emotes

## Job

My job is at Twitch is currently mostly doing these things:

* working on the technical spec for the "signed in devices" feature and working with frontend tech lead, design lead, product manager, and various stakeholders.
* on-call rotation for the services that power people's logged in experience. if users can't log in, they can't chat or do a lot of the things that make twitch money, so when things break there's a lot of pressure to identify root cause and implement mitigations quickly (i.e. being on the hot seat in a 50 person google meet with directors/managers/ICs across the company at 3am on new years eve).
* improving the operational experience of running our services (metrics design, dashboard design, benchmarking, documentation, refactoring code, and infrastructure design)
* handling requests from customer support, trust & safety, security incident response, legal, and other engineering teams that have questions / want to launch new features.
* everything I write is in Golang, occasionally React. I use CDK / Cloudformation for infrastructure management, rarely Terraform.
